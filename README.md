### Why this version is better:
1.  **Badges:** Adds professional visual appeal at the top.
2.  **Emoji usage:** Makes the sections easier to scan visually.
3.  **Code Blocks:** Uses `text` or `bash` tags for better syntax highlighting.
4.  **Checklist:** The "Project Goals" section uses a checklist to show progress and purpose.

**Would you like me to help you write a "How it Works" section explaining the logic behind the file compression or conversion?**
